	  <p>Federal financial aid consists of need-based scholarships, grants, federal work-study, and loans for eligible students. It is unlikely that work-study would be feasible for the MS-HAIL program participants.</p>
	  <p>Federal student loans are available to most students regardless of income and provide a range of repayment options including income-based repayment plans and loan forgiveness benefits, which other education loans are not required to provide.</p>

	<div class="collapse" id="other-aid-hail">
	  <p>You are encouraged to ask your employer if any tuition assistance might be available for you while you take this program.

	<div class="collapse" id="deadline-to-apply-hail">
	  <p>The timeframe from acceptance to the beginning of the MS-HAIL program is very short. In order to maximize the time available, you can begin the financial aid process early by completing most of the process before you even receive your acceptance and student ID (SAA ID) and password in the mail. By completing part of the process early, your financial aid application will be “ready to go” as soon as you are accepted, receive your student ID number, and complete the final on-line financial aid form via the UCSF student portal.</p>
	  <p>Your SAA ID is issued by the Office of Admissions and Registrar (OAR). Please call them at (415) 476-8280 if you do not receive your SAA ID and password after three weeks of your admission to UCSF.</p>

	<div class="collapse" id="how-to-apply-hail">
	  <p>The following documents are required to apply for financial aid:</p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>Free Application for Federal Student Aid (<a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/" target="_blank">FAFSA</a>). You can complete this form right away (before you are admitted). Our FAFSA Federal School Code is “001319”. MS-HAIL is a graduate program. Your grade level is "1st year graduate/professional" student.</li>
	    <li>If you want to borrow a Federal Direct Loan and/or Direct Graduate PLUS loan, you need to complete the Master Promissory Note for the appropriate loan.  A credit check is also required for the Direct Graduate PLUS. You can complete the loan forms and credit check even before you are admitted--this speeds up the process! Please review <a href="/types-of-aid/loans/types-of-loans" target="_blank">information about loans</a> and complete the loan application process through <a href="https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/index.action" target="_blank">StudentLoans.gov</a>.</li>
	    <li>The final step is completing a short UCSF Finaid/COLS Application on our <a href="https://netpartner.ucsf.edu/netpartnerstudent" target="_blank">Student Portal</a>. You cannot complete this final step until you are admitted and receive your SAA ID, which you will need to access the student portal. Please select "Basic Funding" for the financial aid funding option question. This part of the process will only take a few minutes. As soon as you complete the on-line UCSF financial aid questionnaire, the FAFSA and loan information you completed earlier is electronically matched to your UCSF file. A review of your application for financial aid can begin at that point!</li>

	<div class="collapse" id="fin-aid-type-hail">
	  <p>Financial assistance consists mostly of Federal Unsubsidized Direct Loan and Direct Graduate PLUS. Please note that graduate students are no longer eligible for a Subsidized Direct Loan due to legislative changes effective July 1, 2012. Workstudy would potentially be available, based on availability of funds and your ability to secure a workstudy job. It is not likely that workstudy will be feasible for the MS-HAIL participants. (Private loans are another option, but not recommended because the interest on private loans, while lower in some cases, is not stable. Repayment options in the federal loan programs are generally more beneficial than those offered by private loan companies).</p>
	  <p>To apply, you must complete both a FAFSA and <a href="https://netpartner.ucsf.edu/netpartnerstudent" target="_blank">UCSF Finaid/COLS Application</a> as well as all the loan documents.</p>
	  <p>To be eligible for federal financial aid, you must be enrolled for at least 2 courses (6 units) each quarter. If you enroll for only 1 class (3 units), you are not eligible for any federal financial aid for that quarter.</p>
	  <p>Federal student loans are available to most students regardless of income and provide a range of repayment options including income-based repayment plans and loan forgiveness benefits, which other education loans are not required to provide.</p>

	<div class="collapse" id="unsubsidized-loan-hail">
	  <p>Eligibility for this federal loan is based on the standard student budget minus outside scholarships and other financial aid.  It is not based on financial need so student/spouse earnings and assets are not considered.  Per federal regulations, the maximum annual limit is $37,167 (enrolled 12 months) for MS-HAIL (students in MS-HAIL are eligible for the increased lending limit for specified health professions' programs).</p>
	  <p>The interest rate is fixed each year for the life of the loan taken out during that time (July 1 – June 30), unless the loan is consolidated. The current rate is 6.21%. Interest begins to accrue as soon as funds are disbursed. You can elect to make interest payments while you are in school, thereby decreasing the amount you will ultimately repay, or defer interest until after you graduate or cease to be enrolled at least half-time. Accrued interest will be added to the principal (capitalized) at repayment if you choose this option. Loan repayment begins six months after you graduate or cease to be enrolled as a half-time student.</p>
	  <p>Funds are disbursed in equal quarterly installments.  The Department of Education charges a <a href="/types-of-aid/loans/types-of-loans" target="_blank">loan fee</a> which is proportionately deducted from each loan disbursement.</p>
	  <p>Review “Step 3” of our <a href="/application-process/apply-for-aid" target="_blank">application process</a> for more information and to complete the Master Promissory Note.  Once you've e-signed online, our office will receive an electronic notification of your application from the federal processor. You can complete the loan paperwork before you are admitted. Your loan will not be processed, nor any funds disbursed, until you are admitted to the program and begin your coursework.</p>

	  <p>The standard student budget minus all financial aid including Federal Unsubsidized Direct Loan equals your eligibility for a Graduate PLUS.  There is no annual maximum.  Be aware that credit approval is required by the Department of Education for this loan.  In addition to completing the online Federal Graduate PLUS Master Promissory Note, you must also authorize a credit check.  Students who are denied due to adverse credit (e.g., 90 days or more delinquent on any debt, or credit report showing default, loan discharge, foreclosure, repossession, and bankruptcy) may need to have an Endorser (co-borrower).  More information will be provided by the Department of Education.</p>

	<div class="collapse" id="no-credit-approval-hail">
	  <p>The Department of Education requires a credit check for the Graduate PLUS. Students with adverse credit are notified directly, along with their options. Students can appeal if the adverse credit information is incorrect, or provide document to the Department of Education if there are extenuating circumstances relating to their adverse credit history. Visit <a href="http://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/whatYouNeed.action?page=credit" target="_blank">StudentLoans.gov</a> for more information. Students may also be able to apply with an endorser (co-borrower) who satisfies the credit requirements. Students should contact Applicant Services for Grad PLUS Loan Borrowers at 1-800-557-7394 (8am-8pm ET), Monday to Friday, if their loan is denied.</p>
	  <p>UCSF IS UNABLE TO OFFER ANOTHER LOAN TO REPLACE THE GRADUATE PLUS.  Students who are unable to borrow a Graduate PLUS are expected to cover the remainder of their educational expenses with their own resources or family assistance.  It is the student’s responsibility to secure adequate funding to cover cost of attendance before beginning school.</p>

	<div class="collapse" id="disbursement-hail">
	  <p>In general, your financial aid is divided by the number of quarters in which you are expected to enroll within an academic calendar (July 1 to June 30). The MS-HAIL program begins in the winter, which means there are only two terms remaining in the academic calendar before you will need to apply for again for the terms that will take place during the 2014-15 academic year. Your total awards will be divided evenly over the number of terms in which you are enrolled. This means your direct deposits will be disbursed at the beginning of each quarter on a set disbursement date, and NOT in one lump sum. See your Award Letter and view more information on <a href="/application-process/disbursement" target="_blank">disbursement</a>.</p>

	<div class="collapse" id="when-disbursement-hail">
	  <p>Financial aid funds are released immediately prior to the first day of school every quarter (assuming, of course, you applied promptly so your funds have arrived, you registered and filed a study list, and there is no registration hold placed on your account). See our quarterly financial aid <a href="/application-process/disbursement" target="_blank">disbursement</a> schedule.</p>
	  <p>Please sign up for direct deposit so your financial aid can be electronically deposited into your bank account through electronic fund transfer (EFT).  It is faster and safer than waiting to receive a paper check in the US mail.  Information regarding direct deposit will be given to you along with your Financial Aid Offer Letter, as you cannot sign up until after financial aid is awarded.</p>

	<div class="collapse" id="living-cost-hail">
	  <p>The money you receive for living costs from financial aid will be determined by your housing status; off-campus, university housing, or with parents/relatives. Food, utilities, transportation costs (primarily public transit costs), and some personal/miscellaneous costs are all calculated into your budget. Generally, moving expenses cannot be included in your budget. Our office works to calculate a modest, but adequate, student budget. Housing is a considerable part of your cost of living in San Francisco, but there are ways to reduce your costs. Your financial aid budget assumes you will be sharing an apartment with at least one other person and our budget reflects that expectation. Each year the Student Financial Aid Office sets a standard cost of living for the next school year based on extensive research about local costs as well as federal regulations. Review <a href="/application-process/student-budget" target="_blank">student budget</a> page for more details.</p>

	<div class="collapse" id="budget-help-hail">
	  <p>It may be a significant change for some students enrolling at UCSF to adjust to living on a student budget. While we try to provide an adequate budget, this amount is modest and may require some changes in your living habits. A good way to feel comfortable living on financial aid may be to set a monthly budget. You can start with the student budget we provide and see where your expenses differ. The budget we provide is just an example of how you may be spending the money. For example, you might spend less on rent than we allot, but more on food and that will work as long as the amount you need to pay bills each term is equal to the amount you receive. Our financial aid advisors are also here to help. If you find you will have more than enough to live on, consider reducing your loans; we strongly recommends that you borrow only what you need.</p>
	  <p>Some students begin school with personal debt (non-student loans). The expected monthly payments for credit card or other types of consumer loan debt will be hard to make while living on a student budget. The student budget does not include additional funding for debt repayment. If you are concerned about staying current on personal debt while you are enrolled, call us to set up a time you can meet with your financial aid advisor to go over your options, either by phone appointment or in person.</p>
		<p>Another area of concern for many students is funding for transportation. The Student Financial Aid Office includes a monthly transportation cost in the student budget, but not the cost of getting to campus for the two in-person executive weekends, since students will be coming from many different places! Additional funding for transportation can be included in your budget if it is essential for the program and you can complete an <a href="/about-us/forms/#finaidforms" target="_blank">Education Expense Request</a> form, asking for additional transportation funding. For more information, contact the Student Financial Aid Office or view detailed information on your program's <a href="/application-process/student-budget" target="_blank">student budget</a>.</p>

	<div class="collapse" id="leave-of-absence-hail">
	  <p>A leave of absence (LOA) must be approved by a student’s advisor. Students in satisfactory academic standing taking an LOA for less than one year (four consecutive quarters) can reenter the program in any subsequent quarter. For LOAs lasting more than one year, the Program Director must approve the student’s re-entry to the program. Once you are no longer a registered student, most student loans have a <a href="/types-of-aid/loans/loan-repayment" target="_blank">grace period</a> during which loan payments are not due.</p>
	  <p>Federal Unsubsidized Direct Loan and Direct Graduate PLUS will continue to accrue interest during the six month grace period, although no payments will be required.</p>
	  <p>If you re-enroll before using up all of your grace period, you are entitled to the same grace period again upon graduation.  Once the entire grace period is used up during a period of non-enrollment or leave of absence, however, you enter repayment immediately upon graduation.  You still qualify for a grace period for any new loan(s) borrowed after you re-enroll at UCSF, however, which may give you two different repayment dates!</p>
