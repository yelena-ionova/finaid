Can I defer payment now that I am back in school?</a></li>
  	<div class="collapse" id="deferment-general">
  	  <p>You may be able to defer prior educational loan repayment if you are enrolled at least half-time by filing an in-school deferment form with your loan servicer. To do that, you should download the form from your loan servicer’s website, complete your section, and bring it to the Office of the Registrar on or after the first day of school for certification. More information will be provided during the orientation. Our Registrar’s Office also sends student enrollment information to the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) quarterly so loan servicers can be notified about your student status.</p>

  	<div class="collapse" id="leave-of-absence-general">
  	  <p>A leave of absence (LOA) must be approved by a student’s advisor. Students in satisfactory academic standing taking an LOA for less than one year (four consecutive quarters) can reenter the program in any subsequent quarter. For LOAs lasting more than one year, the Program Director must approve the student’s re-entry to the program. Once you are no longer a registered student, most student loans have a <a href="/types-of-aid/loans/loan-repayment" target="_blank">grace period</a> during which loan payments are not due.</p>
  	  <p>Federal Unsubsidized Direct Loan and Direct Graduate PLUS will continue to accrue interest during the six month grace period, although no payments will be required.</p>
  	  <p>If you re-enroll before using up all of your grace period, you are entitled to the same grace period again upon graduation.  Once the entire grace period is used up during a period of non-enrollment or leave of absence, however, you enter repayment immediately upon graduation.  You still qualify for a grace period for any new loan(s) borrowed after you re-enroll at UCSF, however, which may give you two different repayment dates!</p>

  	<div class="collapse" id="living-cost-budget">
  	  <p>The money you receive for living costs from financial aid will be determined by your housing status; off-campus, university housing, or with parents/relatives. Food, utilities, transportation costs (primarily public transit costs), and some personal/miscellaneous costs are all calculated into your budget. Generally, moving expenses cannot be included in your budget. Our office works to calculate a modest, but adequate, student budget. Housing is a considerable part of your cost of living in San Francisco, but there are ways to reduce your costs. Your financial aid budget assumes you will be sharing an apartment with at least one other person and our budget reflects that expectation. Each year the Student Financial Aid Office sets a standard cost of living for the next school year based on extensive research about local costs as well as federal regulations. Review <a href="/application-process/student-budget" target="_blank">student budget</a> page for more details.</p>

    <li data-toggle="collapse" href="#budget-help-budget"><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i><a class="collapsed accordion-toggle" aria-expanded="false" aria-control="budget-help-budget">I've looked over the student budget and would like some help budgeting this money.</a></li>
  	<div class="collapse" id="budget-help-budget">
  	  <p>It may be a significant change for some students enrolling at UCSF to adjust to living on a student budget. While we try to provide an adequate budget, this amount is modest and may require some changes in your living habits. A good way to feel comfortable living on financial aid may be to set a monthly budget. You can start with the student budget we provide and see where your expenses differ. The budget we provide is just an example of how you may be spending the money. For example, you might spend less on rent than we allot, but more on food and that will work as long as the amount you need to pay bills each term is equal to the amount you receive. Our financial aid advisors are also here to help. If you find you will have more than enough to live on, consider reducing your loans; we strongly recommends that you borrow only what you need.</p>
  	  <p>Some students begin school with personal debt (non-student loans). The expected monthly payments for credit card or other types of consumer loan debt will be hard to make while living on a student budget. The student budget does not include additional funding for debt repayment. If you are concerned about staying current on personal debt while you are enrolled, call us to set up a time you can meet with your financial aid advisor to go over your options, either by phone appointment or in person.</p>
  		<p>Another area of concern for many students is funding for transportation. The Student Financial Aid Office includes a monthly transportation cost in the student budget, but not the cost of getting to campus for the two in-person executive weekends, since students will be coming from many different places! Additional funding for transportation can be included in your budget if it is essential for the program and you can complete an <a href="/forms/#finaidforms" target="_blank">Education Expense Request</a> form, asking for additional transportation funding. For more information, contact the Student Financial Aid Office or view detailed information on your program's <a href="/application-process/student-budget" target="_blank">student budget</a>.</p>

  	  <p>In general, your financial aid is divided by the number of quarters in which you are expected to enroll within an academic calendar (July 1 to June 30). The MS-HAIL program begins in the winter, which means there are only two terms remaining in the academic calendar before you will need to apply for again for the terms that will take place during the 2014-15 academic year. Your total awards will be divided evenly over the number of terms in which you are enrolled. This means your direct deposits will be disbursed at the beginning of each quarter on a set disbursement date, and NOT in one lump sum.

Work-Study is also available, based on availability of funds and your ability to secure a work-study job. However, it is not likely that work-study will be feasible for DNP students.

The difference between Basic and Full Funding refers to the TYPES of financial aid for which you are applying.  Full Funding does not mean you are applying for more money than Basic Funding.

      		<div class="collapse" id="nursing-student-loan-nursingmasters">
      		  <p>Eligibility for the Nursing Student Loan is based on financial need so student/spouse earnings and assets are considered.  It has a fixed interest rate of 5% and has no loan fee.  Interest is subsidized (not charged to you) while you are in school and during the nine month grace period.  Interest begins to be charged (and loan repayment begins) nine months after you graduate or cease to be enrolled as a full-time student.</p>

      		  <p>Students must complete at least eight units each quarter to be considered full-time for financial aid purposes. Students who attend at least half-time but take fewer than eight units at any quarter are eligible for Federal Unsubsidized Direct Loan or Direct Graduate PLUS, but not for other types of need-based financial aid for that quarter.</p>

      		  <p>Nursing students are not required to attend summer except for entering MEPN, Postmaster’s students, and second-year Nurse Midwifery students.  If you elect to enroll for summer and need federal financial aid to cover summer tuition and cost of living, you can complete our online <a href="/forms">Summer Enrollment for Nursing Students</a> form.  More information and the web link are sent via the School of Nursing Newsletter each Spring Quarter.  You must confirm your enrollment with a faculty advisor before completing this form, as we need to know which summer session and how many units will you be enrolled, and whether you plan to be full-time for the remainder of the academic year.</p>
