<h4>Food Security for Students</h4>

<p>The economic burdens of professional and graduate education are significant for all students, and there may be times when it is difficult for students to access a sufficient quantity of nutritious food to maintain a healthy and active life.</p>

<p>As a participant in the <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/global-food-initiative/" target="_blank">University of California Global Food Initiative</a>, UC San Francisco has established the <a href="/types-of-aid/housing-food-and-transportation/food">Food Security for Students</a> (FSFS) Program to develop and implement services and resources that address UCSF student nutrition and food insecurity. The FSFS program is supported by a campus allocation from UC President Janet Napolitano.</p>

<h4>Cost of Living Supplement</h4>

<p>San Francisco has become one of the nation's most expensive places to live. To address this reality, the University has instituted concrete plans to develop and complete a substantial amount of <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/affordable-housing-ucsf" target="_blank">new campus housing</a> by 2019, but that leaves many current students without a solution in the meantime.</p>

<p>To bridge the gap for students enrolled in degree programs who are not living in campus housing, UCSF will continue to offer a need-based program to provide a $2,400 <a href="/types-of-aid/housing-food-and-transportation/cols">Cost of Living Supplement</a> (COLS) to current and admitted students in the 2017-18 academic year. The COLS may be used, at the student’s discretion, to help pay for housing or associated costs, such as commuting.</p>

<p><strong>Looking for information about where to live?</strong> Campus housing is often the best option, especially for new students. Visit the <a href="http://campuslifeservices.ucsf.edu/housing/" target="_blank">Campus Life Services — Housing website</a> for information about campus housing as well as useful resources for students who choose to live off-campus.</p>

<h4>UCSF-Lyft Student Program</h4>

<p>
  UCSF Transportation Services partnered with Lyft to pilot a program to provide UCSF students with a <a href="/types-of-aid/housing-food-and-transportation/transportation">Guaranteed Ride Home</a> Program. The program is designed to provide students with a commute option to reach a transit hub, other UCSF campus, or reach their home after our shuttle network has ended for the day. The UCSF-Lyft program is designed for “after-hours” service and requires a unique Lyft code.
