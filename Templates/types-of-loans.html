      <p>Federal student loans are available to most students regardless of income and provide a range of repayment options including income-based repayment plans and loan forgiveness benefits, which other education loans are not required to provide. Federal loans will be submitted to the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS), and will be accessible by student, loan servicers, and institutions determined to be authorized users of the data system.

          <p>The federal Budget Control Act of 2011, passed by Congress, eliminates in-school loan interest subsidizes for graduate and professional students effective July 1, 2012. It also contains provisions that eliminate Direct Loan repayment incentives. Therefore, graduate students are eligible for the unsubsidized loan only.</p>
          <p>The federal government does not pay interest on unsubsidized loans. However, students can choose to make no interest payment on the Direct Unsubsidized loan while enrolled in school. Interest will accrue while in school and during the six-month post-enrollment deferral period, and the Department of Education will add it to the unpaid principal amount when student enters repayment.</p>

          <p>The Annual Direct (Stafford) limits apply to students enrolled in all quarters required for that specific year in their program.  Students enrolled less than the full academic year will have a lower annual limit.</p>
          <p>Undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need may qualify for up to $5500 in subsidized Direct Loan. The federal government generally pays the interest on a subsidized loan while student is enrolled in school for at least half-time, during post-enrollment period, and during any authorized periods of deferment. However, for subsidized Direct Loans in which the first disbursement is made on or after July 1, 2012, and before July 1, 2014, interest subsidy during the six-month post-enrollment deferral period has been eliminated. Students receiving a subsidized loan within this timeframe are responsible for the interest that accrues during post-enrollment period. For students who choose to make no interest payment, interest will accrue and be capitalized (added to the principal balance) when the post-enrollment period ends. This provision does not eliminate the interest subsidy while the borrower is in school or during eligible periods of deferment.</p>
          <p>Students who do not demonstrate financial need or who wish to borrow to replace their calculated student contribution can obtain an unsubsidized loan. See below for Direct (Stafford) Loan limits for undergraduates at UCSF.</p>

	      <p>Federal Direct Graduate Plus Loan is only for students who have exceeded their annual or aggregate Direct (Stafford) loan limit.</p>
	      <p>Some students may require additional funding beyond what the annual or aggregate Federal Direct/Stafford limit allows. The Federal Graduate PLUS Loan is available to students who have not met their full financial aid budget for the year and have met the limits on the Federal Direct/Stafford Loan and other financial aid resources. The maximum loan amount students can borrow is the school’s approved cost of attendance minus other financial aid (i.e., scholarships, grants, Federal Direct Loan, and other loans). This loan is not based on financial need.</p>
	      <p>Interest rate for the Federal Graduate PLUS is fixed at 7.0% (if disbursed after 7/1/2017). Repayment begins six months after borrower graduates or ceases to be enrolled at least half-time.</p>
	      <p>The federal government does not pay interest on the Graduate PLUS loan. Students can choose to pay interest while in school. For borrowers who decide to make no payments, interest will accrue while in school and during the six-month post-enrollment deferral period, and the Department of Education will add it to the unpaid principal amount when they enter repayment. Direct Loan Servicing will mail interest statements twice a year (January & July) to students. Students may sign up for Direct Loan Servicing Electronic Mail Services to receive quarterly interest statements electronically through their Direct Loan servicer.</p>
	      <p>The Department of Education requires a credit check for the Graduate PLUS. Students who are denied due to adverse credit (i.e., 90 days or more delinquent on any debt, or credit report showing default, loan discharge, foreclosure, repossession, and bankruptcy) are notified directly, along with their options. Students can appeal if the adverse credit information is incorrect, or provide document to the Department of Education if there are extenuating circumstances relating to their adverse credit history. Click <a href="https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/whatYouNeed.action?page=credit" target="_blank">here</a> for more information. Students may also be able to apply with an endorser (co-borrower) who satisfies the credit requirements. Students should contact Applicant Services for Grad PLUS Loan Borrowers at 1-800-557-7394 (8 a.m. - 8 p.m. ET), Monday to Friday, if their loan is denied.</p>
	      <p>This loan will be submitted to the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS), and will be accessible by student, loan servicers, and institutions determined to be authorized users of the data system.</p>
	      <p>UCSF is unable to offer another loan to replace the Graduate PLUS loan. Students who are unable to borrow a Graduate PLUS are expected to cover the remainder of their educational expenses with their own resources or family assistance. It is the student’s responsibility to secure adequate funding to cover cost of attendance before beginning school.</p>

	      <p>Over the years, individuals and groups have contributed money to be used for student loans. The interest rate on most University loans is 5 percent. Repayment and interest accrual begin six months after graduation or withdrawal from school.</p>
	      <p>University loans are considered to be “private” loans even though their interest rates and repayment benefits are often comparable or even better than federal loan rates and benefits.</p>
	      <p>In compliance with SB 1289, we are providing the following disclosure about loans: Federal student loans are available to most students regardless of income and provide a range of repayment options including income-based repayment plans and loan forgiveness benefits, which other education loans are not required to provide.</p>

	      <p>The Nursing Student Loan program has a 5 percent interest rate which does not accrue until nine months after graduation or if the borrower ceases to be a full-time student. Repayment also starts at that time. The maximum amount students can borrow annually is $3,300 for each of the first two years, $5,200 for each of the final two years, or the amount of the student's financial need, whichever is less.

	    <p>This program provides 5 percent loans to medical students who plan to practice in primary care. Recipients must complete a primary care residency and then practice in primary care (<a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/loanscholarships/loans/primarycare.html" target="_blank">click here for a list of primary care specialties and requirements</a>). An independent student is no longer required to submit parental financial information to determine financial need. The determination of need for such information will still be at the discretion of the school's financial aid office. The Division of Student Loans and Scholarships (DSLS) defines an independent student as a student who is at least 24 years of age and has not been listed as a dependent on his or her parent's tax forms within the last three years. Dependent students are still required to submit parental financial information to determine whether a contribution to the cost of education is expected. Repayment and interest begin one year after the student ceases full time studies or obtains the first professional degree. The maximum that can be borrowed is cost of attendance minus expected family contribution and any other aid. Amounts beyond the annual maximum limit may be available to third and fourth year medical students, if the excess funds are used only to repay outstanding loan balances on loans taken out while the student was in attendance at UCSF. Additional information will be sent to medical students who indicate interest on the UCSF financial aid questionnaire. Students can also obtain information by contacting the Student Financial Aid Office.</p>

	    <p>Although many UCSF students can obtain sufficient funds through Federal and University loans, others need additional help. Comparisons of federal versus private loans are available from the <a href="http://studentaid.ed.gov/types/loans/federal-vs-private" target="_blank">Department of Education</a> and <a href="https://www.aamc.org/services/first/first_factsheets/285378/federalvsprivate.html" target="_blank">Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC)</a>.  Federal loan programs generally offer better terms and conditions than private loans.  Students should therefore pursue federal financial aid and other resources such as outside agency scholarships before borrowing a private loan.  Private Loans are only awarded after all types of federal student loans have been awarded to the student.</p>
	    <p>In compliance with SB 1289, we are providing the following <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/student-affairs/_files/loans/sb1289-with-uc-loans.pdf" target="_blank">disclosure</a> about loans.</p>
	    <p>Each year, regulatory changes and market conditions impact individual lenders’ loan terms. To help students and families make informed choices, the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) compiles comprehensive Private Student Loans Lists that contain loan terms and interest rates as well as lender contact information. Lenders were invited to compete for placement on each of these loan products. From those who responded, a systemic and equitable method for selecting the top lenders was held. These lenders had to meet a stringent standard of requirements that included, but were not limited to, competitive borrower benefits, lender stability, efficient loan servicing, online support and tools, and customer service.</p>
	    <p>Below are the lenders who were selected by UCOP, and their most up-to-date loan terms at the date of this publication. Please note that loan terms are subject to change by the lenders. Furthermore, these loan terms are offered to the University of California and not necessarily other colleges.</p>
	    <p>While the University carefully considers our selections in order to provide you with the best possible list of suggested lenders, you have the right to use another lender that is not on this list. The choice of a loan lender is your decision.  The Student Financial Aid Office will certify private loan applications from all lenders.</p>
	    <p>The Student Financial Aid Office does not accept or receive inducements from lenders in exchange for inclusion in the Private Student Loans List, nor do we share in the profits from student loans. Please also see The University of California Code of Conduct in Regard to Preferred Lender Arrangements.</p>
	    <p>All borrowers are required to complete a <a href="http://www.ifap.ed.gov/dpcletters/attachments/GEN1001A-AppSelfCert.pdf" target="_blank">self-certification form</a> and submit it to their lender prior to receiving a private education loan. Most lenders provide the form as part of their online loan application.</p>
      <p>
        Each UCOP Private Student Loans List includes required Truth-in-Lending Agreement (TILA) Disclosure from the lenders.
