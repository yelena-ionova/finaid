  	  <p>Financial aid consists of loans and federal work-study for eligible students. It is unlikely that work-study would be feasible for the MS-HPL program participants.</p>
  	  <p>Federal student loans are available to most students regardless of income and provide a range of repayment options including income-based repayment plans and loan forgiveness benefits, which other education loans are not required to provide.</p>

  	<div class="collapse" id="deadline-to-apply-hpl">
  	  <p>You can begin the financial aid process early by completing the FAFSA, and then the Finaid/COLS Application after you receive your student ID (SAA ID) and password in the mail.</p>
  	  <p>Your SAA ID is issued by the Office of Admissions and Registrar (OAR). Please call them at (415) 476-8280 if you do not receive your SAA ID and password after three weeks of your admission to UCSF.</p>

  	<div class="collapse" id="how-to-apply-hpl">
  	  <p>The following documents are required to apply for financial aid:</p>
  	  <ol>
  	    <li>Free Application for Federal Student Aid (<a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/" target="_blank">FAFSA</a>). You can complete this form right away (before you are admitted). Our FAFSA Federal School Code is “001319”. MS-HPL is a graduate program. Your grade level is "1st year graduate/professional" student.</li>
  	    <li>If you want to borrow a Federal Direct Loan and/or Direct Graduate PLUS loan, you need to complete the Master Promissory Note for the appropriate loan.  A credit check is also required for the Direct Graduate PLUS. You can complete the loan forms and credit check even before you are admitted--this speeds up the process! Please review <a href="/types-of-aid/loans/types-of-loans" target="_blank">information about loans</a> and complete the loan application process through <a href="https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/index.action" target="_blank">StudentLoans.gov</a>.</li>
  	    <li>The final step is completing a short UCSF Finaid/COLS Application on our <a href="https://netpartner.ucsf.edu/netpartnerstudent" target="_blank">Student Portal</a>. You cannot complete this final step until you are admitted and receive your SAA ID, which you will need to access the student portal. Please select "Basic Funding" for the financial aid funding option question. This part of the process will only take a few minutes. As soon as you complete the on-line UCSF financial aid questionnaire, the FAFSA and loan information you completed earlier is electronically matched to your UCSF file. A review of your application for financial aid can begin at that point!</li>

  	<div class="collapse" id="fin-aid-type-hpl">
  	  <p>Financial assistance consists mostly of Federal Unsubsidized Direct Loan and Direct Graduate PLUS. Please note that graduate students are no longer eligible for a Subsidized Direct Loan due to legislative changes effective July 1, 2012. Work-Study would potentially be available, based on availability of funds and your ability to secure a work-study job. It is not likely that work-study will be feasible for the MS-HPL students. Private loans are another option. However, interest rates on private loans, while lower in some cases, are not stable. Repayment options in the federal loan programs are generally more beneficial than those offered by private loan companies. Federal student loans are available to most students regardless of income and provide a range of repayment options including income-based repayment plans and loan forgiveness benefits, which other education loans are not required to provide.</p>
  	  <p>To be eligible for federal financial aid, you must be enrolled for at least half-time as prescribed by your curriculum. If you drop below half-time, you are not eligible for any federal financial aid for that quarter.</p>

  	<div class="collapse" id="length-of-program-hpl">
  	  <p>The MS-HPL can be completed in 1 year of full-time enrollment, or 2 years of half-time enrollment. If you need to extend your program or take a Leave of Absence, you must notify the financial aid office as well as the school. To qualify for financial aid for any quarter, you must be enrolled at least half-time as prescribed by the curriculum.</p>

  	<div class="collapse" id="subsidized-loan-hpl">
  	  <p>Due to the federal Budget Control Act of 2011, passed by Congress, graduate students are no longer eligible for Federal Subsidized Direct Loan. Graduate students may apply for a Federal Unsubsidized Direct Loan.</p>

  	<div class="collapse" id="unsubsidized-loan-hpl">
  	  <p>Eligibility for this federal loan is based on the standard student budget minus outside scholarships and other financial aid. It is not based on financial need so student/spouse earnings and assets are not considered. Per federal regulations, the maximum annual limit is $20,500 for MS-HPL students.</p>
  	  <p>The interest rate is fixed each year for the life of the loan taken out during that time (July 1 – June 30), unless the loan is consolidated. The current rate (7/1/2016 - 6/30/2017) is 5.31%. Interest begins to accrue as soon as funds are disbursed. You can elect to make interest payments while you are in school, thereby decreasing the amount you will ultimately repay, or defer interest until after you graduate or cease to be enrolled at least half-time. Accrued interest will be added to the principal (capitalized) at repayment if you choose this option. Loan repayment begins six months after you graduate or cease to be enrolled as a half-time student.</p>
  	  <p>Funds are disbursed in equal quarterly installments.  The Department of Education charges a <a href="/types-of-aid/loans/types-of-loans" target="_blank">loan fee</a> which is proportionately deducted from each loan disbursement. The current loan fee is 1.069%.</p>
  	  <p>Review “Step 3” of our <a href="/application-process/apply-for-aid" target="_blank">application process</a> for more information and to complete the Master Promissory Note.  Once you've e-signed online, our office will receive an electronic notification of your application from the federal processor. You can complete the loan paperwork before you are admitted. Your loan will not be processed, nor any funds disbursed, until you are admitted to the program and begin your coursework.</p>

  	  <p>The standard student budget minus all financial aid including Federal Unsubsidized Direct Loan equals your eligibility for a Graduate PLUS.  There is no annual maximum.  Be aware that credit approval is required by the Department of Education for this loan.  In addition to completing the online Federal Graduate PLUS Master Promissory Note, you must also authorize a credit check.  Students who are denied due to adverse credit (e.g., 90 days or more delinquent on any debt, or credit report showing default, loan discharge, foreclosure, repossession, and bankruptcy) may need to have an Endorser (co-borrower).  More information will be provided by the Department of Education.</p>

  	<div class="collapse" id="no-credit-approval-hpl">
  	  <p>The Department of Education requires a credit check for the Graduate PLUS. Students with adverse credit are notified directly, along with their options. Students can appeal if the adverse credit information is incorrect, or provide document to the Department of Education if there are extenuating circumstances relating to their adverse credit history. Visit <a href="http://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/whatYouNeed.action?page=credit" target="_blank">StudentLoans.gov</a> for more information. Students may also be able to apply with an endorser (co-borrower) who satisfies the credit requirements. Students should contact Applicant Services for Grad PLUS Loan Borrowers at 1-800-557-7394 (8am-8pm ET), Monday to Friday, if their loan is denied.</p>
  	  <p>UCSF IS UNABLE TO OFFER ANOTHER LOAN TO REPLACE THE GRADUATE PLUS.  Students who are unable to borrow a Graduate PLUS are expected to cover the remainder of their educational expenses with their own resources or family assistance.  It is the student’s responsibility to secure adequate funding to cover cost of attendance before beginning school.</p>

  	<div class="collapse" id="disbursement-hpl">
  	  <p>In general, your financial aid is divided by the number of quarters in which you are expected to enroll within an academic calendar (July 1 to June 30). The MS-HAIL program begins in the winter, which means there are only two terms remaining in the academic calendar before you will need to apply for again for the terms that will take place during the 2014-15 academic year. Your total awards will be divided evenly over the number of terms in which you are enrolled. This means your direct deposits will be disbursed at the beginning of each quarter on a set disbursement date, and NOT in one lump sum. See your Award Letter and view more information on <a href="/application-process/disbursement" target="_blank">disbursement</a>.</p>

  	<div class="collapse" id="when-disbursement-hpl">
  	  <p>Financial aid funds are released immediately prior to the first day of school every quarter (assuming, of course, you applied promptly so your funds have arrived, you registered and filed a study list, and there is no registration hold placed on your account). See our quarterly financial aid <a href="/application-process/disbursement" target="_blank">disbursement</a> schedule.</p>
  	  <p>Please sign up for direct deposit so your financial aid can be electronically deposited into your bank account through electronic fund transfer (EFT).  It is faster and safer than waiting to receive a paper check in the US mail.  Information regarding direct deposit will be given to you along with your Financial Aid Offer Letter, as you cannot sign up until after financial aid is awarded.</p>

  	<div class="collapse" id="living-cost-hpl">
  	  <p>The money you receive for living costs from financial aid will be determined by your housing status; off-campus, university housing, or with parents/relatives. Food, utilities, transportation costs (primarily public transit costs), and some personal/miscellaneous costs are all calculated into your budget. Generally, moving expenses cannot be included in your budget. Our office works to calculate a modest, but adequate, student budget. Housing is a considerable part of your cost of living in San Francisco, but there are ways to reduce your costs. Your financial aid budget assumes you will be sharing an apartment with at least one other person and our budget reflects that expectation. Each year the Student Financial Aid Office sets a standard cost of living for the next school year based on extensive research about local costs as well as federal regulations. Review <a href="/application-process/student-budget" target="_blank">student budget</a> page for more details.</p>

  	<div class="collapse" id="leave-of-absence-hpl">
  	  <p>A leave of absence (LOA) must be approved by a student’s advisor. Students in satisfactory academic standing taking an LOA for less than one year (four consecutive quarters) can reenter the program in any subsequent quarter. For LOAs lasting more than one year, the Program Director must approve the student’s re-entry to the program. Once you are no longer a registered student, most student loans have a <a href="/types-of-aid/loans/loan-repayment" target="_blank">grace period</a> during which loan payments are not due.</p>
  	  <p>Federal Unsubsidized Direct Loan and Direct Graduate PLUS will continue to accrue interest during the six month grace period, although no payments will be required.</p>
  	  <p>If you re-enroll before using up all of your grace period, you are entitled to the same grace period again upon graduation.  Once the entire grace period is used up during a period of non-enrollment or leave of absence, however, you enter repayment immediately upon graduation.  You still qualify for a grace period for any new loan(s) borrowed after you re-enroll at UCSF, however, which may give you two different repayment dates!</p>

  	  <p>The timeframe from acceptance to the beginning of the MS-HAIL program is very short. In order to maximize the time available, you can begin the financial aid process early by completing most of the process before you even receive your acceptance and student ID (SAA ID) and password in the mail. By completing part of the process early, your financial aid application will be “ready to go” as soon as you are accepted, receive your student ID number, and complete the final on-line financial aid form via the UCSF student portal.</p>

  	<div class="collapse" id="how-to-apply-hail">
  	  <p>The following documents are required to apply for financial aid:</p>
  	  <ol>
  	    <li>Free Application for Federal Student Aid (<a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/" target="_blank">FAFSA</a>). You can complete this form right away (before you are admitted). Our FAFSA Federal School Code is “001319”. MS-HAIL is a graduate program. Your grade level is "1st year graduate/professional" student.</li>
  	    <li>If you want to borrow a Federal Direct Loan and/or Direct Graduate PLUS loan, you need to complete the Master Promissory Note for the appropriate loan.  A credit check is also required for the Direct Graduate PLUS. You can complete the loan forms and credit check even before you are admitted--this speeds up the process! Please review <a href="/types-of-aid/loans/types-of-loans" target="_blank">information about loans</a> and complete the loan application process through <a href="https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/index.action" target="_blank">StudentLoans.gov</a>.</li>
  	    <li>The final step is completing a short UCSF Finaid/COLS Application on our <a href="https://netpartner.ucsf.edu/netpartnerstudent" target="_blank">Student Portal</a>. You cannot complete this final step until you are admitted and receive your SAA ID, which you will need to access the student portal. Please select "Basic Funding" for the financial aid funding option question. This part of the process will only take a few minutes. As soon as you complete the on-line UCSF financial aid questionnaire, the FAFSA and loan information you completed earlier is electronically matched to your UCSF file. A review of your application for financial aid can begin at that point!</li>

  	  <p>Financial assistance consists mostly of Federal Unsubsidized Direct Loan and Direct Graduate PLUS.

Workstudy would potentially be available, based on availability of funds and your ability to secure a workstudy job. It is not likely that workstudy will be feasible for the MS-HAIL participants. (Private loans are another option, but not recommended because the interest on private loans, while lower in some cases, is not stable. Repayment options in the federal loan programs are generally more beneficial than those offered by private loan companies).</p>
  	  <p>To apply, you must complete both a FAFSA and <a href="https://netpartner.ucsf.edu/netpartnerstudent" target="_blank">UCSF Finaid/COLS Application</a> as well as all the loan documents.</p>

  	  <p>Eligibility for this federal loan is based on the standard student budget minus outside scholarships and other financial aid.  It is not based on financial need so student/spouse earnings and assets are not considered.

  	  <p>The interest rate is fixed each year for the life of the loan taken out during that time (July 1 – June 30), unless the loan is consolidated. The current rate is 6.21%. Interest begins to accrue as soon as funds are disbursed. You can elect to make interest payments while you are in school, thereby decreasing the amount you will ultimately repay, or defer interest until after you graduate or cease to be enrolled at least half-time. Accrued interest will be added to the principal (capitalized) at repayment if you choose this option. Loan repayment begins six months after you graduate or cease to be enrolled as a half-time student.</p>

  	<div class="collapse" id="living-cost-hail">
  	  <p>The money you receive for living costs from financial aid will be determined by your housing status; off-campus, university housing, or with parents/relatives. Food, utilities, transportation costs (primarily public transit costs), and some personal/miscellaneous costs are all calculated into your budget. Generally, moving expenses cannot be included in your budget. Our office works to calculate a modest, but adequate, student budget. Housing is a considerable part of your cost of living in San Francisco, but there are ways to reduce your costs. Your financial aid budget assumes you will be sharing an apartment with at least one other person and our budget reflects that expectation. Each year the Student Financial Aid Office sets a standard cost of living for the next school year based on extensive research about local costs as well as federal regulations. Review <a href="/application-process/student-budget" target="_blank">student budget</a> page for more details.</p>

  	<div class="collapse" id="budget-help-hail">
  	  <p>It may be a significant change for some students enrolling at UCSF to adjust to living on a student budget. While we try to provide an adequate budget, this amount is modest and may require some changes in your living habits. A good way to feel comfortable living on financial aid may be to set a monthly budget. You can start with the student budget we provide and see where your expenses differ. The budget we provide is just an example of how you may be spending the money. For example, you might spend less on rent than we allot, but more on food and that will work as long as the amount you need to pay bills each term is equal to the amount you receive. Our financial aid advisors are also here to help. If you find you will have more than enough to live on, consider reducing your loans; we strongly recommends that you borrow only what you need.</p>
  	  <p>Some students begin school with personal debt (non-student loans). The expected monthly payments for credit card or other types of consumer loan debt will be hard to make while living on a student budget. The student budget does not include additional funding for debt repayment. If you are concerned about staying current on personal debt while you are enrolled, call us to set up a time you can meet with your financial aid advisor to go over your options, either by phone appointment or in person.</p>
  		<p>Another area of concern for many students is funding for transportation. The Student Financial Aid Office includes a monthly transportation cost in the student budget, but not the cost of getting to campus for the two in-person executive weekends, since students will be coming from many different places! Additional funding for transportation can be included in your budget if it is essential for the program and you can complete an <a href="/forms/#finaidforms" target="_blank">Education Expense Request</a> form, asking for additional transportation funding. For more information, contact the Student Financial Aid Office or view detailed information on your program's <a href="/application-process/student-budget" target="_blank">student budget</a>.</p>

  	<div class="collapse" id="leave-of-absence-hail">
  	  <p>A leave of absence (LOA) must be approved by a student’s advisor. Students in satisfactory academic standing taking an LOA for less than one year (four consecutive quarters) can reenter the program in any subsequent quarter. For LOAs lasting more than one year, the Program Director must approve the student’s re-entry to the program. Once you are no longer a registered student, most student loans have a <a href="/types-of-aid/loans/loan-repayment" target="_blank">grace period</a> during which loan payments are not due.</p>
  	  <p>Federal Unsubsidized Direct Loan and Direct Graduate PLUS will continue to accrue interest during the six month grace period, although no payments will be required.</p>
  	  <p>If you re-enroll before using up all of your grace period, you are entitled to the same grace period again upon graduation.  Once the entire grace period is used up during a period of non-enrollment or leave of absence, however, you enter repayment immediately upon graduation.  You still qualify for a grace period for any new loan(s) borrowed after you re-enroll at UCSF, however, which may give you two different repayment dates!</p>

	    <p>The first year of our MEPN program is considered “self-supporting” so fees are higher because there is no state subsidy.  In the second and third year of the program (after your RN licensure is obtained), you will pay the same tuition as Master’s program students.</p>

		<div class="collapse" id="not-california-resident-mepn">
		  <p>During the initial year of the MEPN program, you are not required to pay a Nonresident Supplemental Tuition.  All entering students pay the same self-supporting fee.

		<div class="collapse" id="other-aid-mepn">
		  <p>During your initial year in the self-supporting program, the School of Nursing offers a MEPN Grant to qualified students.  After the initial year (once you matriculate into the regular Master’s coursework), you may qualify for scholarships, traineeships, fellowships, and fee remissions administered by the School of Nursing and Graduate Division.  Contact the <a href="http://nursing.ucsf.edu/admissions-financial-aid/financial_aid" target="_blank">School of Nursing</a> for more information as the school has a separate criteria for determining eligibility for these funds.  The school also publicizes outside and departmental funding opportunities in its online Student Newsletters.  You can also obtain information about graduate support from the <a href="https://graduate.ucsf.edu/financial-support/" target="_blank">Graduate Division</a>.</p>
		  <p>If you are a regular status employee of UC while completing the Master’s coursework, you may be eligible for <a href="http://registrar.ucsf.edu/registration/reduced-fee-enrollment" target="_blank">two-thirds reduction</a> of both the Student Services Fee and Tuition.

		<div class="collapse" id="how-to-apply-mepn">
		  <p>The following documents are required to apply for federal financial aid:</p>
		  <ol>
		    <li>Free Application for Federal Student Aid (<a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/" target="_blank">FAFSA</a>). You can complete this form right away (before you are admitted). Our FAFSA Federal School Code is “001319”. MEPN is a graduate program. Your grade level is "1st year graduate/professional" student. UCSF does not require parental information on the FAFSA.</li>
		    <li>If you want to borrow a Federal Direct Loan and/or Direct Graduate PLUS loan, you need to complete the Master Promissory Note for the appropriate loan.  A credit check is also required for the Direct Graduate PLUS. You can complete the loan forms and credit check even before you are admitted--this speeds up the process! Please review <a href="/types-of-aid/loans/types-of-loans" target="_blank">information about loans</a> and complete the loan application process through <a href="https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/index.action" target="_blank">StudentLoans.gov</a>.</li>
		    <li>The final step is completing a short UCSF Finaid/COLS Application on our <a href="https://netpartner.ucsf.edu/netpartnerstudent" target="_blank">Student Portal</a>. Apply as soon as you receive your acceptance and student ID (SAA ID) and password in the mail.  Submit your application materials and supporting documents as soon as possible in order to allow time for us to disburse your funding in time for the beginning of school. Your SAA ID is issued by the Office of Admissions and Registrar (OAR).  Please call them at (415) 476-8280 if you do not receive your SAA ID and password after three weeks of your admission to UCSF.</li>

		<div class="collapse" id="fin-aid-type-mepn">
		  <p>ENTERING STUDENTS: Financial assistance for first year MEPN students consists of Federal Unsubsidized Direct Loan and Direct Graduate PLUS.  Some UCSF nursing loans may be awarded depending on availability. Please note that graduate students are no longer eligible for a Subsidized Direct Loan due to legislative changes effective July 1, 2011.</p>
		  <p>CONTINUING STUDENTS: As you matriculate to the Master’s program, you can apply for Full Funding or Basic Funding. Basic Funding consists of Nursing Student Loan, Federal Work-Study, Federal Unsubsidized Direct Loan, and Direct Graduate PLUS. Full Funding includes all UCSF campus need-based aid (i.e., campus scholarships, grants, Nursing Student Loan, and university loans) as well as Federal Unsubsidized Direct Loan and Direct Graduate PLUS. The difference between Basic and Full Funding refers to the TYPES of financial aid for which you are applying.  Full Funding does not mean you are applying for more money than Basic Funding. To apply for either Basic or Full Funding, you must complete both a FAFSA and UCSF Finaid/COLS Application. If you are under age 30 and want to apply for Full Funding, you also need to complete the CSS PROFILE and submit your parent's information and their federal tax return.  See our <a href="/application-process/apply-for-aid" target="_blank">Apply for Aid</a> page for more information. Federal student loans are available to most students regardless of income and provide a range of repayment options including income-based repayment plans and loan forgiveness benefits, which other education loans are not required to provide.</p>

		<div class="collapse" id="parents-info-mepn">
		  <p>As a Graduate student, you are considered an "independent."  However, that means almost ALL of the students at UCSF are independent.  UCSF needs a secondary tool to determine a student's “financial need" for our limited UCSF grant and loan programs.  We use your parent's information to calculate a "Family Strength Index" and use that in determining what your "financial need." However, if you are 30 years old or over, UCSF will not take your parent's information into account for Full Funding consideration.

		<div class="collapse" id="nursing-student-loan-mepn">
		  <p>Eligibility for the Nursing Student Loan is based on financial need so student/spouse earnings and assets are considered.  It has a fixed interest rate of 5% and has no loan fee.  Interest is subsidized (not charged to you) while you are in school and during the nine month grace period.  Interest begins to be charged (and loan repayment begins) nine months after you graduate or cease to be enrolled as a full-time student.</p>

		<div class="collapse" id="subsidized-loan-mepn">

		<div class="collapse" id="unsubsidized-loan-mepn">
		  <p>Eligibility for this federal loan is based on the standard student budget minus outside scholarships and other financial aid.  It is not based on financial need so student/spouse earnings and assets are not considered.  The maximum annual limit is $20,500 for nursing students.</p>
		  <p>The interest rate is fixed each year for the life of the loan taken out during that time (July 1 - June 30), unless the loan is consolidated.  The current rate (7/1/2016 - 6/30/2017) is 5.31%.  The current loan fee is 1.069%.  Interest begins to accrue as soon as funds are disbursed.  You can elect to make interest payments while you are in school, thereby decreasing the amount you will ultimately repay, or defer interest until after you graduate or cease to be enrolled at least half-time.  Accrued interest will be added to the principal (capitalized) at repayment if you choose this option.   Loan repayment begins six months after you graduate or cease to be enrolled as a half-time student.</p>
		  <p>Funds are disbursed in equal quarterly installments.  The Department of Education charges a <a href="/types-of-aid/loans/types-of-loans" target="_blank">loan fee</a> which is proportionately deducted from each loan disbursement.</p>

		  <p>The standard student budget minus all financial aid including Federal Unsubsidized Direct Loan equals your eligibility for a Graduate PLUS.  There is no annual maximum.  Be aware that credit approval is required by the Department of Education for this loan.  In addition to completing the online Federal Graduate PLUS Master Promissory Note, you must also authorize a credit check.  Students who are denied due to adverse credit (e.g., 90 days or more delinquent on any debt, or credit report showing default, loan discharge, foreclosure, repossession, and bankruptcy) may need to have an Endorser (co-borrower).

		<div class="collapse" id="no-credit-approval-mepn">
		  <p>The Department of Education requires a credit check for the Graduate PLUS. Students with adverse credit are notified directly, along with their options. Students can appeal if the adverse credit information is incorrect, or provide document to the Department of Education if there are extenuating circumstances relating to their adverse credit history. Visit <a href="http://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/whatYouNeed.action?page=credit" target="_blank">StudentLoans.gov</a> for more information. Students may also be able to apply with an endorser (co-borrower) who satisfies the credit requirements.

		  <p>UCSF IS UNABLE TO OFFER ANOTHER LOAN TO REPLACE THE GRADUATE PLUS.  Students who are unable to borrow a Graduate PLUS are expected to cover the remainder of their educational expenses with their own resources or family assistance.

		  <p>The money you receive for living costs from financial aid will be determined by your housing status; off-campus, university housing, or with parents/relatives. Food, utilities, transportation costs (primarily public transit costs), and some personal/miscellaneous costs are all calculated into your budget. Generally, moving expenses cannot be included in your budget. Our office works to calculate a modest, but adequate, student budget. Housing is a considerable part of your cost of living in San Francisco, but there are ways to reduce your costs. Your financial aid budget assumes you will be sharing an apartment with at least one other person and our budget reflects that expectation. Each year the Student Financial Aid Office sets a standard cost of living for the next school year based on extensive research about local costs as well as federal regulations. Review <a href="/application-process/student-budget" target="_blank">student budget</a> page for more details.</p>

		<div class="collapse" id="budget-help-mepn">
		  <p>It may be a significant change for some students enrolling at UCSF to adjust to living on a student budget. While we try to provide an adequate budget, this amount is modest and may require some changes in your living habits. A good way to feel comfortable living on financial aid may be to set a monthly budget. You can start with the student budget we provide and see where your expenses differ. The budget we provide is just an example of how you may be spending the money. For example, you might spend less on rent than we allot, but more on food and that will work as long as the amount you need to pay bills each term is equal to the amount you receive. You may find additional budgeting help at <a href="http://www.ecmc.org/overview/financial-awareness-basics.html" target="_blank">Edfund’s Financial Awareness Basics</a>. Our financial aid advisors are also here to help. If you find you will have more than enough to live on, consider reducing your loans; we strongly recommends that you borrow only what you need.</p>
		  <p>Some students begin school with personal debt (non-student loans). The expected monthly payments for credit card or other types of consumer loan debt will be hard to make while living on a student budget. The student budget does not include additional funding for debt repayment. If you are concerned about staying current on personal debt while you are enrolled, call us to set up a time you can meet with your financial aid advisor to go over your options, either by phone appointment or in person.</p>
			<p>Another area of concern for many students is funding for transportation. The Student Financial Aid Office includes a monthly transportation cost in the student budget, but not the cost of getting to campus for the two in-person executive weekends, since students will be coming from many different places! Additional funding for transportation can be included in your budget if it is essential for the program and you can complete an <a href="/forms/#finaidforms" target="_blank">Education Expense Request</a> form, asking for additional transportation funding. For more information, contact the Student Financial Aid Office or view detailed information on your program's <a href="/application-process/student-budget" target="_blank">student budget</a>.</p>

		<div class="collapse" id="leave-of-absence-mepn">
		  <p>You can elect to take a “step-out” year after the first year.  You may also request for a leave of absence for other reasons by contacting the School of Nursing. Once you are no longer a registered student, most student loans have a <a href="/types-of-aid/loans/loan-repayment" target="_blank">grace period</a> during which loan payments are not due.</p>
		  <p>The Nursing Student Loan has a nine month grace period during which loan payments are not due and no interest will accrue.</p>
		  <p>The Federal Unsubsidized Direct Loan and Direct Graduate PLUS will continue to accrue interest during the six month grace period, although no payments will be required.</p>
		  <p>If you re-enroll before using up all of your grace period, you are entitled to the same grace period again upon graduation.  Once the entire grace period is used up during a period of non-enrollment or leave of absence, however, you enter repayment immediately upon graduation.  You still qualify for a grace period for any new loan(s) borrowed after you re-enroll at UCSF, however, which may give you two different repayment dates!</p>

		<div class="collapse" id="how-to-apply-nursingmasters">
		  <p>The following documents are required to apply for federal financial aid:</p>
		  <ol>
		    <li>Free Application for Federal Student Aid (<a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/" target="_blank">FAFSA</a>). You can complete this form right away (before you are admitted). Our FAFSA Federal School Code is “001319”. MEPN is a graduate program. Your grade level is "1st year graduate/professional" student. UCSF does not require parental information on the FAFSA.</li>
		    <li>Complete a short UCSF Finaid/COLS Application on our <a href="https://netpartner.ucsf.edu/netpartnerstudent" target="_blank">Student Portal</a>. Apply as soon as you receive your acceptance and student ID (SAA ID) and password in the mail.  Submit your application materials and supporting documents as soon as possible in order to allow time for us to disburse your funding in time for the beginning of school. Your SAA ID is issued by the Office of Admissions and Registrar (OAR).  Please call them at (415) 476-8280 if you do not receive your SAA ID and password after three weeks of your admission to UCSF.</li>
				<li>If you are under age 30 by December 31, 2017, and want to apply for Full Funding, you also need to complete the CSS PROFILE and submit your parents' information and their federal tax return.  UCSF's CSS Profile code is "7152".  Please review "Parents’ Information" section on <a href="/application-process/apply-for-aid">Apply for Aid</a> for more information.</li>
		    <li>If you want to borrow a Federal Direct Loan and/or Direct Graduate PLUS loan, you need to complete the Master Promissory Note for the appropriate loan.  A credit check is also required for the Direct Graduate PLUS. You can complete the loan forms and credit check even before you are admitted--this speeds up the process! Please review <a href="/types-of-aid/loans/types-of-loans" target="_blank">information about loans</a> and complete the loan application process through <a href="https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/index.action" target="_blank">StudentLoans.gov</a>.</li>

		  <p>As a Graduate student, you are considered an "independent."  However, that means almost ALL of the students at UCSF are independent.

		<div class="collapse" id="living-cost-nursingmasters">
		  <p>The money you receive for living costs from financial aid will be determined by your housing status; off-campus, university housing, or with parents/relatives. Food, utilities, transportation costs (primarily public transit costs), and some personal/miscellaneous costs are all calculated into your budget. Generally, moving expenses cannot be included in your budget. Our office works to calculate a modest, but adequate, student budget. Housing is a considerable part of your cost of living in San Francisco, but there are ways to reduce your costs. Your financial aid budget assumes you will be sharing an apartment with at least one other person and our budget reflects that expectation. Each year the Student Financial Aid Office sets a standard cost of living for the next school year based on extensive research about local costs as well as federal regulations. Review <a href="/application-process/student-budget" target="_blank">student budget</a> page for more details.</p>

		<div class="collapse" id="budget-help-nursingmasters">
		  <p>It may be a significant change for some students enrolling at UCSF to adjust to living on a student budget. While we try to provide an adequate budget, this amount is modest and may require some changes in your living habits. A good way to feel comfortable living on financial aid may be to set a monthly budget. You can start with the student budget we provide and see where your expenses differ. The budget we provide is just an example of how you may be spending the money. For example, you might spend less on rent than we allot, but more on food and that will work as long as the amount you need to pay bills each term is equal to the amount you receive. You may find additional budgeting help at <a href="http://www.ecmc.org/overview/financial-awareness-basics.html" target="_blank">Edfund’s Financial Awareness Basics</a>. Our financial aid advisors are also here to help. If you find you will have more than enough to live on, consider reducing your loans; we strongly recommends that you borrow only what you need.</p>
		  <p>Some students begin school with personal debt (non-student loans). The expected monthly payments for credit card or other types of consumer loan debt will be hard to make while living on a student budget. The student budget does not include additional funding for debt repayment. If you are concerned about staying current on personal debt while you are enrolled, call us to set up a time you can meet with your financial aid advisor to go over your options, either by phone appointment or in person.</p>
			<p>Another area of concern for many students is funding for transportation. The Student Financial Aid Office includes a monthly transportation cost in the student budget, but not the cost of getting to campus for the two in-person executive weekends, since students will be coming from many different places! Additional funding for transportation can be included in your budget if it is essential for the program and you can complete an <a href="/forms/#finaidforms" target="_blank">Education Expense Request</a> form, asking for additional transportation funding. For more information, contact the Student Financial Aid Office or view detailed information on your program's <a href="/application-process/student-budget" target="_blank">student budget</a>.</p>

		<div class="collapse" id="leave-of-absence-nursingmasters">
		  <p>You may request for a leave of absence by contacting the School of Nursing.  Once you are no longer a registered student, most student loans have a <a href="/types-of-aid/loans/loan-repayment" target="_blank">grace period</a> during which loan payments are not due.</p>
		  <p>The Nursing Student Loan has a nine month grace period during which loan payments are not due and no interest will accrue.</p>
		  <p>University Loan has a six month grace period during which loan payments are not due and no interest will accrue.</p>
		  <p>The Federal Unsubsidized Direct Loan and Direct Graduate PLUS will continue to accrue interest during the six month grace period, although no payments will be required.</p>
		  <p>If you re-enroll before using up all of your grace period, you are entitled to the same grace period again upon graduation.  Once the entire grace period is used up during a period of non-enrollment or leave of absence, however, you enter repayment immediately upon graduation.  You still qualify for a grace period for any new loan(s) borrowed after you re-enroll at UCSF, however, which may give you two different repayment dates!</p>

		  <ol>
		    <li>Free Application for Federal Student Aid (<a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/" target="_blank">FAFSA</a>). You can complete this form right away (before you are admitted). Our FAFSA Federal School Code is “001319”. MEPN is a graduate program. Your grade level is "1st year graduate/professional" student. UCSF does not require parental information on the FAFSA.</li>

		    <li>If you want to borrow a Federal Direct Loan and/or Direct Graduate PLUS loan, you need to complete the Master Promissory Note for the appropriate loan.  A credit check is also required for the Direct Graduate PLUS. You can complete the loan forms and credit check even before you are admitted--this speeds up the process!

		  <p>Eligibility for this federal loan is based on the standard student budget minus outside scholarships and other financial aid.  It is not based on financial need so student/spouse earnings and assets are not considered.  The maximum annual limit is $20,500 for nursing students.</p>
		  <p>The interest rate is fixed each year for the life of the loan taken out during that time (July 1 - June 30), unless the loan is consolidated.  The current rate (7/1/2016 - 6/30/2017) is 5.31%.  The current loan fee is 1.069%.  Interest begins to accrue as soon as funds are disbursed.  You can elect to make interest payments while you are in school, thereby decreasing the amount you will ultimately repay, or defer interest until after you graduate or cease to be enrolled at least half-time.  Accrued interest will be added to the principal (capitalized) at repayment if you choose this option.   Loan repayment begins six months after you graduate or cease to be enrolled as a half-time student.</p>

This means your direct deposits and/or "fee offsets" will be disbursed at the beginning of each quarter on a set disbursement date, and NOT in one lump sum. See your Award Letter and view more information on <a href="/application-process/disbursement" target="_blank">disbursement</a>.</p>

		<div class="collapse" id="living-cost-nursingdoctoral">
		  <p>The money you receive for living costs from financial aid will be determined by your housing status; off-campus, university housing, or with parents/relatives. Food, utilities, transportation costs (primarily public transit costs), and some personal/miscellaneous costs are all calculated into your budget. Generally, moving expenses cannot be included in your budget. Our office works to calculate a modest, but adequate, student budget. Housing is a considerable part of your cost of living in San Francisco, but there are ways to reduce your costs. Your financial aid budget assumes you will be sharing an apartment with at least one other person and our budget reflects that expectation. Each year the Student Financial Aid Office sets a standard cost of living for the next school year based on extensive research about local costs as well as federal regulations. Review <a href="/application-process/student-budget" target="_blank">student budget</a> page for more details.</p>

		<div class="collapse" id="budget-help-nursingdoctoral">
		  <p>It may be a significant change for some students enrolling at UCSF to adjust to living on a student budget. While we try to provide an adequate budget, this amount is modest and may require some changes in your living habits. A good way to feel comfortable living on financial aid may be to set a monthly budget. You can start with the student budget we provide and see where your expenses differ. The budget we provide is just an example of how you may be spending the money. For example, you might spend less on rent than we allot, but more on food and that will work as long as the amount you need to pay bills each term is equal to the amount you receive. You may find additional budgeting help at <a href="http://www.ecmc.org/overview/financial-awareness-basics.html" target="_blank">Edfund’s Financial Awareness Basics</a>. Our financial aid advisors are also here to help. If you find you will have more than enough to live on, consider reducing your loans; we strongly recommends that you borrow only what you need.</p>
		  <p>Some students begin school with personal debt (non-student loans). The expected monthly payments for credit card or other types of consumer loan debt will be hard to make while living on a student budget. The student budget does not include additional funding for debt repayment. If you are concerned about staying current on personal debt while you are enrolled, call us to set up a time you can meet with your financial aid advisor to go over your options, either by phone appointment or in person.</p>
			<p>Another area of concern for many students is funding for transportation. The Student Financial Aid Office includes a monthly transportation cost in the student budget, but not the cost of getting to campus for the two in-person executive weekends, since students will be coming from many different places! Additional funding for transportation can be included in your budget if it is essential for the program and you can complete an <a href="/forms/#finaidforms" target="_blank">Education Expense Request</a> form, asking for additional transportation funding. For more information, contact the Student Financial Aid Office or view detailed information on your program's <a href="/application-process/student-budget" target="_blank">student budget</a>.</p>

		<div class="collapse" id="leave-of-absence-nursingdoctoral">
		  <p>You may request for a leave of absence by contacting the School of Nursing.  Once you are no longer a registered student, most student loans have a <a href="/types-of-aid/loans/loan-repayment" target="_blank">grace period</a> during which loan payments are not due.</p>
		  <p>The Federal Unsubsidized Direct Loan and Direct Graduate PLUS will continue to accrue interest during the six month grace period, although no payments will be required.</p>
		  <p>If you re-enroll before using up all of your grace period, you are entitled to the same grace period again upon graduation.  Once the entire grace period is used up during a period of non-enrollment or leave of absence, however, you enter repayment immediately upon graduation.  You still qualify for a grace period for any new loan(s) borrowed after you re-enroll at UCSF, however, which may give you two different repayment dates!</p>

		  <ol>
		    <li>Free Application for Federal Student Aid (<a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/" target="_blank">FAFSA</a>). You can complete this form right away (before you are admitted). Our FAFSA Federal School Code is “001319”. MEPN is a graduate program. Your grade level is "1st year graduate/professional" student. UCSF does not require parental information on the FAFSA.</li>

		    <li>If you want to borrow a Federal Direct Loan and/or Direct Graduate PLUS loan, you need to complete the Master Promissory Note for the appropriate loan.  A credit check is also required for the Direct Graduate PLUS. You can complete the loan forms and credit check even before you are admitted--this speeds up the process!

		  <p>Eligibility for this federal loan is based on the standard student budget minus outside scholarships and other financial aid.  It is not based on financial need so student/spouse earnings and assets are not considered.  The maximum annual limit is $20,500 for nursing students.</p>
		  <p>The interest rate is fixed each year for the life of the loan taken out during that time (July 1 - June 30), unless the loan is consolidated.  The current rate (7/1/2016 - 6/30/2017) is 5.31%.  The current loan fee is 1.069%.  Interest begins to accrue as soon as funds are disbursed.  You can elect to make interest payments while you are in school, thereby decreasing the amount you will ultimately repay, or defer interest until after you graduate or cease to be enrolled at least half-time.  Accrued interest will be added to the principal (capitalized) at repayment if you choose this option.   Loan repayment begins six months after you graduate or cease to be enrolled as a half-time student.</p>
		  <p>Funds are disbursed in equal quarterly installments.  The Department of Education charges a <a href="/types-of-aid/loans/types-of-loans" target="_blank">loan fee</a> which is proportionately deducted from each loan disbursement.</p>

		  <p>You may be able to defer prior educational loan repayment by filing an in-school deferment form with your loan servicer.  To do that, you should download the form from your loan servicer’s website, complete your section, and bring it to the School of Nursing, Student Affairs Office, #N-319X on or after the first day of school for certification.</p>

		<div class="collapse" id="living-cost-nursingpostmasters">
		  <p>The money you receive for living costs from financial aid will be determined by your housing status; off-campus, university housing, or with parents/relatives. Food, utilities, transportation costs (primarily public transit costs), and some personal/miscellaneous costs are all calculated into your budget. Generally, moving expenses cannot be included in your budget. Our office works to calculate a modest, but adequate, student budget. Housing is a considerable part of your cost of living in San Francisco, but there are ways to reduce your costs. Your financial aid budget assumes you will be sharing an apartment with at least one other person and our budget reflects that expectation. Each year the Student Financial Aid Office sets a standard cost of living for the next school year based on extensive research about local costs as well as federal regulations. Review <a href="/application-process/student-budget" target="_blank">student budget</a> page for more details.</p>

		<div class="collapse" id="budget-help-nursingpostmasters">
		  <p>It may be a significant change for some students enrolling at UCSF to adjust to living on a student budget. While we try to provide an adequate budget, this amount is modest and may require some changes in your living habits. A good way to feel comfortable living on financial aid may be to set a monthly budget. You can start with the student budget we provide and see where your expenses differ. The budget we provide is just an example of how you may be spending the money. For example, you might spend less on rent than we allot, but more on food and that will work as long as the amount you need to pay bills each term is equal to the amount you receive. You may find additional budgeting help at <a href="http://www.ecmc.org/overview/financial-awareness-basics.html" target="_blank">Edfund’s Financial Awareness Basics</a>. Our financial aid advisors are also here to help. If you find you will have more than enough to live on, consider reducing your loans; we strongly recommends that you borrow only what you need.</p>
		  <p>Some students begin school with personal debt (non-student loans). The expected monthly payments for credit card or other types of consumer loan debt will be hard to make while living on a student budget. The student budget does not include additional funding for debt repayment. If you are concerned about staying current on personal debt while you are enrolled, call us to set up a time you can meet with your financial aid advisor to go over your options, either by phone appointment or in person.</p>
			<p>Another area of concern for many students is funding for transportation. The Student Financial Aid Office includes a monthly transportation cost in the student budget, but not the cost of getting to campus for the two in-person executive weekends, since students will be coming from many different places! Additional funding for transportation can be included in your budget if it is essential for the program and you can complete an <a href="/forms/#finaidforms" target="_blank">Education Expense Request</a> form, asking for additional transportation funding. For more information, contact the Student Financial Aid Office or view detailed information on your program's <a href="/application-process/student-budget" target="_blank">student budget</a>.</p>

		<div class="collapse" id="leave-of-absence-nursingpostmasters">
		  <p>You may request for a leave of absence by contacting the School of Nursing.  Once you are no longer a registered student, most student loans have a <a href="/types-of-aid/loans/loan-repayment" target="_blank">grace period</a> during which loan payments are not due.</p>
		  <p>The Federal Unsubsidized Direct Loan and Direct Graduate PLUS will continue to accrue interest during the six month grace period, although no payments will be required.</p>
		  <p>If you re-enroll before using up all of your grace period, you are entitled to the same grace period again upon graduation.  Once the entire grace period is used up during a period of non-enrollment or leave of absence, however, you enter repayment immediately upon graduation.  You still qualify for a grace period for any new loan(s) borrowed after you re-enroll at UCSF, however, which may give you two different repayment dates!</p>
