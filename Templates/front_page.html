      <h4><a href="https://heartland.ecsi.net" target="_blank">Transition from ACS Education to Heartland ECSI</a></h4>
      <p>If you have an institutional student loan from a University of California campus (such as a Perkins Loan, Health Professional student loan, and/or an institutional loan, but NOT a federal Direct Loan), your student loan will now be serviced by Heartland ECSI. Previously, University of California was using ACS to service your loan(s), collect payments, send billing statements, etc. This change will provide you with new options, such as paying by credit card and accessing ECSIâ€™s EasyPath mobile app for your iPhone or Android device.</p>
