        The first step to successful repayment is choosing the right plan at the right time.  Borrowers may change plans as needed, and there are no prepayment penalties for student loans.
      </p>
      <strong>Federal Loan Repayment Plans</strong>
      <p>The Repayment Plan Grid summarizes the available repayment plans for Federal Loans (Direct Unsubsidized or Subsidized Loans, Grad Plus Loans, and, for the most part, older Stafford loans called "FFEL" loans). Most UCSF graduates want a plan with a lower payment due each month at first, especially if pursuing residency, fellowship, or other continuing training.  However, seeking the "lowest" payment available is not the best long-term plan - as with other interest-bearing debt, the longer you take, the more it will cost over the life of the loan. The Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans all offer a way to tie your minimum required payment to your current annual earnings and the one you choose depends largely upon your monthly budget and whether your loans qualify for each plan.  To see what your monthly payments will look like under each of the available plans use the Repayment Estimator, available at <a href="http://studentloans.gov/" target="_blank">studentloans.gov</a>.  Once you sign in, you can view your loans, enter your salary, your marital status, number of dependents and tax filing status, and you can get a very good idea of what your monthly payments will be under each plan.
      </p>
      <strong>Other Loans</strong>
      <p>
        University of California, Health Professions, Nursing Student Loans and Federal Perkins loans each have their own terms and conditions for grace periods, repayment options, as well as deferment and forbearance options. They do NOT qualify for the repayment plans shown in the Loan Repayment Plan Grid above.  However, all of these loans (except University loans) may be included in a Federal consolidation loan and the balances transferred to the new loan become eligible for Income-Driven Repayment and qualify for Public-Service Loan Forgiveness.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you do your required Exit counseling upon graduating or withdrawing from the University, you will see a chart that will show you your minimum payments (usually quarterly payments are shown.)

    <div class="collapse" id="consolidation">
      <strong>What is Consolidation</strong>
      <p>Consolidation is the process of combining one or more student loans into a new, single loan.</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul">
        <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-circle"></i>Consolidation uses a weighted average approach to a new interest rate, rounded up to the nearest 1/8%, so deciding to include or not include some of your loans depends on loan balances, interest rates on each loan, repayment strategy, and repayment benefits such as longer grace periods or deferments on your loans.</li>
        <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-circle"></i>Consolidation creates a new loan, and underlying loans are paid off.  You cannot return to your loans as they were in their original state prior to consolidation.</li>
        <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-circle"></i>Generally, you cannot consolidate an existing consolidation loan again unless you include an additional, Direct Loan or FFEL Program loan in the consolidation.</li>

      <strong>Reasons to Consolidate</strong>
      <ul class="fa-ul">
        <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-circle"></i>If your loans are with multiple servicers, and you want to simplify your payments.</li>

      <strong>Private Consolidation / Loan Refinancing</strong>
      <p>Some companies offer to purchase your federal, institutional, and other private debt and offer you a new, private loan.  Terms and conditions of these loans are at the discretion of the lender.  Before pursuing a private consolidation offered at a lower interest rate, be sure you read the fine print, understand all the terms and conditions of the new loan, and understand what federal benefits (such as Income-Driven Repayment, deferment, forbearance, forgiveness plans, fixed interest rates, and death/disability benefits) you may be losing by refinancing your federal debt to private debt.</p>

    <li data-toggle="collapse" href="#grace-period"><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i><strong><a class="collapsed accordion-toggle" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="grace-period">Grace Period</a></strong></li>
	<div class="collapse" id="grace-period">
	  <p>Many student loans provide a "grace period" immediately following graduation. This is a time when payments are not required and, in some cases, interest does not accrue. The grace period must be used before you can obtain deferments. Some loan programs provide another grace period, lasting six months, after periods of approved deferment. The Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan and Unsubsidized Direct Loan charge interest during the six-month allowable grace period. See the Grace/Deferment chart below for specific grace period information for the various federal student loan programs. if you took a leave of absence from your undergraduate education or interrupted your graduate school studies (for research, illness, etc.), your loans were placed in grace at that time. Whether or not you receive a grace period upon graduation depends on the length of time you were away from undergraduate or graduate school and the policies of the individual loan programs. The status of your grace period (or lack thereof) is vitally important since it usually affects when your deferment period begins and, ultimately, when actual loan repayment begins.</p>

      <strong>Activated for Military Duty</strong>
      <p>Being on active duty for more than 30 days extends your grace period for up to three years. This essentially means your loans do not enter grace or deferment during active duty.</p>
	</div>

    <li data-toggle="collapse" href="#deferment"><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i><strong><a class="collapsed accordion-toggle" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="deferment">Deferment</a></strong></li>
    <div class="collapse" id="deferment">
      <strong>What is Deferment</strong>
      <p>Deferment is a temporary period during which you are not required to make payments. You qualify for deferments based on a condition such as unemployment, enrollment, fellowship program, military service, etc. They are often given for twelve months.  Deferment, if you qualify, is often a better option for borrowers than forbearance since any subsidized loan that you may have do not accrue interest during deferment.  Eligibility requirements for qualified deferments differ based on loan type and the date the loan was originated.  For a more complete listing of eligible deferments, please click on your loan servicer's website or visit the <a href="http://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/understand/servicers" target="_blank">Department of Education's Direct Loan website</a>.  An important consideration to choosing to accept a deferment is that any unsubsidized loans continue to accrue interest and that interest is capitalized (added onto the principal of the loan) at the end of the deferment.</p>

      <strong>Education Related Deferments</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>Graduate Fellowship Deferment
          <p>If you are engaged in a full-time course of study in a qualified graduate fellowship program, you may be eligible to qualify for an education related Graduate Fellowship Deferment.  Your fellowship program must provide financial support to allow for full-time study for at least six months.  A graduate fellowship program official must certify your deferment form indicating that you meet all the eligibility requirements.  You may download this deferment form from your loan servicer(s).  If you are applying for a Graduate Fellowship Deferment, ensure that you send a deferment form to ALL of your loan servicers.  In addition, we suggest following up with your loan servicers to confirm that your deferment has been approved.  For more information, please contact your loan servicer and/or view the <a href="http://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/understand/servicers">Department of Education's Direct Loan website</a> for more details.</p>
        </li>
        <li>In-School Deferment
          <p>In-school deferment allows you to temporarily suspend student loan payments while you are enrolled in an eligible school at least half-time.  If this is your first quarter of enrollment at UCSF and you have previous educational loans from undergraduate studies, you may need to complete an in-school deferment form (download the form from your servicer's website). However, after enrollment reporting is completed for the quarter, your loans may automatically be deferred. The Registrar's Office at UCSF can assist you in getting in-school deferment forms certified for your enrollment at UCSF.  You will want to log onto your account with your loan servicer(s) to make sure the new status is applied to your account.</p>
          <p>If you are returning to UCSF from a leave of absence after doing research, after obtaining an additional degree at another institution, or after taking time off from your curriculum, we recommend that you actively complete an in-school deferment form, and submit the completed form to all of your loan servicers (including those that service your federal and campus loans).  For campus loans, please contact <a href="https://controller.ucsf.edu/how-to-guides/contracts-grants-accounting/student-accounting/assistance-students-loans" target="_blank">Student Accounting office</a>.  For federal loans, log onto <a href="http://www.nslds.ed.gov/nslds_SA/" target="_blank">nslds.ed.gov</a> to obtain contact information for all of your federal loan servicers.  Perkins loans' borrowers should contact the institution from where the loan was originated. For UCSF, the <a href="https://controller.ucsf.edu/how-to-guides/contracts-grants-accounting/student-accounting/assistance-students-loans" target="blank">Student Accounting Office</a> can assist you with deferments on Perkins, Health Professions Loans, Loans for Disadvantaged Students, Nursing Student Loans, and University Loans.  Again, it is essential that you follow-up to ensure that your loan status has been adjusted as you requested.  Please click <a href="/forms">here</a> for a copy of the Department of Education's in-school deferment form.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>NOTE: Deferments on Federal Stafford (Direct or FFEL) loans are NOT available because you are in a medical residency program though a forbearance is available. Institutional loans such as Perkins, HPSL, Nursing, and University Loans, however, have varying availability of deferments in residency or advanced training programs.</p>
    </div>

    <li data-toggle="collapse" href="#forbearance"><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i><strong><a class="collapsed accordion-toggle" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="forbearance">Forbearance</a></strong></li>
    <div class="collapse" id="forbearance">
      <strong>What is Forbearance</strong>
      <p>Forbearance is the most costly alternative to actual repayment because interest accrues on both your subsidized and unsubsidized federal loans. However, forbearance might be your only viable option.  Be sure to explore all of the Income-Driven Repayment plan options before choosing forbearance; payments may be lower than you might assume when driven by your current income.  If you apply for and receive a forbearance for 12 months, and your financial situation changes to allow for payment - you may, and often should, elect to leave the forbearance status.  During the process of applying for forbearance, continue to make payments and do not assume forbearance has been approved until you receive written confirmation from your lender or loan servicer.</p>
      <strong>Forbearance During Delinquency</strong>
      <p>If your loans become delinquent due to non-payment, you will have to “bring them current” before any deferment can be allowed. In many cases, your lender or servicer will grant a forbearance for the time period between the payment due date and the date your loans can enter a deferment status. Any time forbearance is granted, remember that interest accrues on the loans, making them more expensive. Forbearance is not granted automatically, and must be specifically requested.</p>
    </div>

    <li data-toggle="collapse" href="#payments-during-grace-deferment-forbearance"><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i><strong><a class="collapsed accordion-toggle" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="payments-during-grace-deferment-forbearance">Payments during Grace Period, Deferment or Forbearance</a></strong></li>
	<div class="collapse" id="payments-during-grace-deferment-forbearance">
	  <p>Making a loan payment during a period of grace, deferment or forbearance can lower the total amount you pay over the life of your loan. For loans that do not charge interest during grace or deferment, any payments you make during this period will reduce your principal balance. When interest begins to accrue, it will be based on a smaller balance, thus reducing the total interest you have to pay.</p>
	  <p>Making payments on loans that charge interest during grace or deferment periods, or for any loans in forbearance also reduces your total obligation. While the general rule of thumb is to pay the interest "as you go" for loans accruing interest, you may want to make payments to reduce the principal balance, rather than (or in addition to) the interest.</p>
	  <p>The chart below demonstrates the difference between making interest-only payments and paying off a small percentage of the principal balance. The example is based on a $10,000 private loan (such as the Alternative Loan Program available through the Association of American Medical Colleges) and assuming an interest of 8.25 percent accrues during forbearance.</p>
